# Data Science Enrichment (DSE) 2023-24

This is the github repository for DSE for the academic year 2023-24. The repository will hold all session material and will be updated after each session.

DSE sessions are non-assessed, in-person (face to face), and not mandatory sessions that provide additional useful information and knowledge, not included in the Data Science or Fintech programmes.

Due to the nature of the unit, the sessions are designed to be as independent from each other as possible, so that you can attend the ones you think might be most useful to you. The sessions will introduce tools that might be useful in your core units such as version control, project planning, report writing and presentations. 

In academic year 2023-24 this unit is delivered by Theo Constantinides (Unit Director), Dr. Dalila Avdic, Dr. Sebastien Rochat, Dr. Efi Psomopoulou, and Gaby Miles, plus occasionally guests will be joining us.

## Schedule

Sessions run on Thursdays 3-6pm for TB1, and Fridays 2-5pm for TB2, in MVB 1.11/1.11A.

There are many sessions without a topic (Topic TBD). We will try to fill these with guest speakers, workshops, or activities. We might also cancel some sessions to help you with your workload (especially during assessment periods). Details for these sessions will be announced later.
